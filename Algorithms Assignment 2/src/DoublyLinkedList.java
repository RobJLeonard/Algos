/**
 * Class DoublyLinkedList: implements a *generic* Doubly Linked List.
 * @param <T> This is a type parameter. T is used as a class name in the
 * definition of this class.
 *
 * When creating a new DoublyLinkedList, T should be instantiated with an
 * actual class name that extends the class Comparable.
 * Such classes include String and Integer.
 *
 * For example to create a new DoublyLinkedList class containing String data: 
 *    DoublyLinkedList<String> myStringList = new DoublyLinkedList<String>();
 *
 * The class offers a toString() method which returns a comma-separated sting of
 * all elements in the data structure.
 * 
 * This is a bare minimum class you would need to completely implement.
 * You can add additional methods to support your code. Each method will need
 * to be tested by your jUnit tests -- for simplicity in jUnit testing
 * introduce only public methods.
